##user-defined function
# function is a block of code that performs a specific tasks.

# two types of functions:
#1. built in function  -- knows what they have to do
#2. user-defined function -- we will make our own functions

### functions come with parenthesis...


#define our function

# def func1():
#     name = input()
#     print("How are you? ", name)

# func1()


def sum(x, y, z):
    print("the sum is", x+y+z)

sum(2, 3, 4)
