# When multiple operators are used in an arithmetic expression,
# it is evaluated on the basis of precedence(priority) of the operators.

# () - parenthesis is having the highest precedence
# whereas "logical or" is having the lowest precedence.

#     =3+8 = 11

#Association - associativity: If there is a tie between operators of same
